## 1. Introduction

The Home Karaoke project combines a user-friendly web interface built with JavaScript and React on the frontend with a robust Python backend. It allows you to manage and organize your song library and provides a karaoke player to sing along with your favorite tracks.

## 2. Project Structure

The project's file structure is organized as follows:

- `/frontend`: Contains the React-based frontend code.
- `/backend`: Contains the Python-based backend code.
- `/songs`: This is where you can store your song files.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm for the frontend.
- Python 3.x for the backend.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

## 4. Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the Home Karaoke application:

### Frontend Setup:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory of the project.

3. Run the following command to install frontend dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Once the installation is complete, start the frontend server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the Home Karaoke frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup:

1. Open another terminal window.

2. Navigate to the `/backend` directory of the project.

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the backend server:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Home Karaoke backend on `http://localhost:5000`.

## 5. Usage

With both the frontend and backend servers running, you can access the Home Karaoke application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. Here, you can:

- Add and manage songs in your library.
